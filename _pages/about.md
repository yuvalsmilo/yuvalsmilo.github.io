I am a CIRES postdoctoral fellow and my research fields lies at the intersection of computational geomorphology, hydrometeorology and natural hazards. My research projects integrate numerical modeling of sediment dynamics and landscape evolution, field observations/measurements and quantitative analysis of topography. My current main project focus on land â€“ atmosphere interactions across time scales; from event-scale to long-term landscape evolution. I'm especially interested in implementing high resolution hydroclimate realisms and detailed surface properties into sediment dynamics and landscape evolution modeling.
