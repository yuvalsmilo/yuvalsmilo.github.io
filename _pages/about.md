I am an Earth Scientist and my research fields lies at the intersection of computational geomorphology, hydrometeorology and natural hazards. My research projects often integrate field observations and measurements, quantitative analysis of topography and numerical modeling. 
My current projects focus on land â€“ atmosphere interactions across time scales; from event-scale to long-term landscape evolution. I'm especially interested in implementing high resolution hydroclimate realisms and detailed surface properties into sediment dynamics and landscape evolution modeling to address scientific challenges in understanding the evolution of Earth's landscape.
