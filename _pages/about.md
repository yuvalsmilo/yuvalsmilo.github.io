I am a CIRES postdoctoral fellow and my research fields lies at the intersection of computational geomorphology, hydrometeorology and natural hazards. My research projects integrate numerical modeling of sediment dynamics and landscape evolution, field observations/measurements and quantitative analysis of topography. I'm especially interested in implementing high resolution hydroclimate realisms and detailed description of surface properties into landscape evolution modeling to solve scientific questions across time scales.
